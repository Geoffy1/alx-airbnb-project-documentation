# ALX Airbnb Backend Blueprint: Feature Foundations Documentation

## Project Overview

This repository serves as the comprehensive documentation for the backend blueprint of an Airbnb Clone project. It outlines the foundational features, functionalities, and system designs required to build a robust, scalable, and user-friendly rental marketplace application.

The documentation covers various aspects of backend development, from initial feature identification and user interaction flows to detailed data management and process mapping.

## Documentation Structure

This repository is organized into several key sections, each dedicated to a specific aspect of the backend design and requirements:

### 1. Features and Functionalities
* **Purpose:** Provides a detailed list and description of all core backend features.
* **Location:** [`features-and-functionalities/README.md`](./features-and-functionalities/README.md)
* **Visual Aid:** Includes a feature map diagram (`features-map.png`).

### 2. Use Case Diagram
* **Purpose:** Visualizes the interactions between different types of users (actors) and the backend system.
* **Location:** [`use-case-diagram/README.md`](./use-case-diagram/README.md)
* **Visual Aid:** Contains the Use Case Diagram (`use-case-diagram.png`).

### 3. User Stories
* **Purpose:** Translates the use case interactions into user-centric narratives, describing functionalities from an end-user's perspective.
* **Location:** [`user-stories/user-stories.md`](./user-stories/user-stories.md)
* **Overview:** [`user-stories/README.md`](./user-stories/README.md)

### 4. Data Flow Diagram (DFD)
* **Purpose:** Illustrates how data moves through the backend system, detailing inputs, processes, and outputs for core operations.
* **Location:** [`data-flow-diagram/data-flow.png`](./data-flow-diagram/data-flow.png)
* **Overview:** (Optional) [`data-flow-diagram/README.md`](./data-flow-diagram/README.md)

### 5. Flowchart for System Processes
* **Purpose:** Maps the detailed workflow and steps for a specific key backend process (e.g., Property Booking).
* **Location:** [`flowcharts/data-flow-diagram.png`](./flowcharts/data-flow-diagram.png)
* **Overview:** (Optional) [`flowcharts/README.md`](./flowcharts/README.md)

### 6. Requirement Specifications
* **Purpose:** Documents the detailed technical and functional requirements for selected backend features, including API endpoints, validation rules, and performance criteria.
* **Location:** [`requirements.md`](./requirements.md)

## Getting Started

Navigate through the directories listed above. Each `README.md` file (or direct image/document file) will guide you through the specifics of that section.
